# ShuniDex

A beauty way to search Pokemon data to enjoy the journey of capturing Pokemon in Legend Arceus.

## Intention

There are awesome websites and wikis with tons of data about Pokemon. This project is focused in show the Pokedex in a friendly way.

I try to focus in UI/UX (it's not my field, doing my best)

Features that should be done for `1.0.0`:

- Home page with Searching and helpful section
- Evolution and Preevolution animations
- Location Map
- Pokemon details page: items, location, favorite food, tasks, shiny form

## Deploy Locally

`npm start` is enough to deploy this locally
